( GitHub project ) After you complete this workshop, you'll have a basic understanding of the following: Deploy an existing Java microservices containerized application example to Code Engine See the usage of the IBM Cloud Code Engine CLI Understand internal and external HTTP/HTTPS routing between the microservices Use the Out-Of-The-Box monitoring for the example application Use the Out-Of-The-Box logging for the example application The scope of this workshop is not to explain every aspect of running an application or job on Code Engine . It's just about containerized applications. Here is a 1-hour YouTube live stream on IBM Developer Prerequisites \u00b6 In order to run this workshop, you will need to create an IBM Cloud PayAsYouGo account (or log in to your existing account). Code Engine has a free tier per month, and we expect, if you haven't used that free tier in current month, you can execute the workshop without creating any additional costs. For the monitoring and logging we will use free lite plans for the service instances IBM Cloud Monitoring and IBM Cloud Log Analysis . You should have a basic understanding of containerized applications Estimated time and level \u00b6 Time Level 1 h beginners Architecture \u00b6 This workshop is related to the Cloud Native Starter project. In the workshop we use a customized version of the security application example . The example application simply shows articles protected with an Identity and Access Management . In the following picture you see the frontend with the articles and the valid user alice is logged on. The following diagram shows the architecture of the example application. There is a web-app frontend application that serves the JavaScript/Vue.js code to the browser. The web-app code running in the browser invokes a REST API of the web-api microservice. The web-api microservice in turn invokes a REST API of the articles microservice. Keycloak is used for the Identity and Access Management of that microservices based application. To see the results in the web application, users need to be authenticated and they need to have the role user . The image below shows the dependencies of the example: External and internal routing In our context it's useful to have a basic understanding of the routing for example application. Based on the functionality of the application, we need three external routes for the example application. Each external route communication will be automatically secured with a TLS Encryption created by Code Engine using Let's encrypt . The three applications are the web-app which will be loaded into the browser, the Keycloak that must be available for the authentication/authorization to our application and for potential configuration the Identity and Access Management and finally the web-api microservice which provides the articles data and will be invoked be the web-app . The articles microservice doesn't need to be invoked from external, so it's configured to provide only an internal route , which is used by the web-api microservice to get the articles from. Basics about the deployment For an easy deployment prebuild containers were created and pushed to a Quay container registry . In the following table you see the application /container, the exposed routes , uses of TLS Encryption , the scale to zero configuration, the container registry where the prebuild container comes from, the configuration for vCPU and Memory in GB and the min/max Instances for the applications. Application Route TLS Encryption Scale to zero Container Registry vCPU Memory min Instances max Instances web-app external yes yes Quay 0.5 1 GB 0 1 keycloak external yes no Docker 0.5 1 GB 1 1 web-api external yes yes Quay 0.5 1 GB 0 1 articles internal no (mTLS coming sone) yes Quay 0.25 0.5G GB 0 1 The Keycloak application for the Identity and Access Management isn't configured to scale to zero , because the application is stateful and contains the realm configuration, which will be deleted, if you would restart the application.

Step 5: Inspect the configurations tab \u00b6 Here we find four tabs used to configure the application instance on Code Engine . First select the Code tab. Here you see our container image reference to the Quay container registry. Then select the Runtime tab. It displays the configuration for the instances, vCPU, memory and requests. Note: The maximum number of requests that can be processed concurrently per instance. This value is optional. The default value is 100. Note: For more details about valid vCPU and Memory combinations please visit the documentation here . Now select the Environment variables tab. Here you see the routes for the wep-api microservice to setup the connections internal articels microservice and the external Keycloak application. In the Command overrides tab. A short extract of the Code Engine documentation: \"These metadata fields are called Entrypoint and Command. For those users who are familiar with Dockerfile, the fields equate to the ENTRYPOINT and CMD commands . These two fields contain arrays of strings that are combined to create the command line that is used when you run your container.\" For details visit the IBM Cloud documentation . Step 6: Endpoints tab \u00b6 Here you can change the endpoint visibility. For our web-api application we need a public visibility because the application is invoked by our web-app frontend. Step 7: Verify the Code Engine CLI application instance configuration \u00b6 In following code you see the Code Engine CLI invocation for the web-api microservice, this code is used in the bash script to create a Code Engine application instance. It reflects what you have seen in the Code Engine UI . Note: The only difference is the threshold of concurrent requests per instance at which one or more additional instances are created is defined. Use this value to scale up instances based on concurrent number of requests. If --concurrency-target is not specified, this option defaults to the value of the --concurrency option. This value is optional. The default value is 0 . # Valid vCPU and memory combinations: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-mem-cpu-combo ibmcloud ce application create --name web-api \\ --image \"quay.io/ $REPOSITORY /web-api-ce:v7\" \\ --cpu \"0.5\" \\ --memory \"1G\" \\ --env QUARKUS_OIDC_AUTH_SERVER_URL = \" $KEYCLOAK_URL /auth/realms/quarkus\" \\ --env CNS_ARTICLES_URL = \"http://articles. $NAMESPACE .svc.cluster.local/articles\" \\ --max-scale 1 \\ --min-scale 0 \\ --concurrency-target 100 \\ --port 8081 Step 8: Estimate cost \u00b6 You can easily estimate cost for your Code Engine application.

Code Engine has a free tier per month and we expect, if you haven't used that free tier in current month, you can execute the workshop without creating any additional costs. For the monitoring and logging we will use free lite plans for the service instances of IBM Cloud Monitoring and IBM Cloud Log Analysis . Here you find the actual Code Engine pricing . The image blow shows a screen shot from 26. May 2021 of the free tier . Architecture \u00b6 The following simplified architecture diagram show the dependencies of the Code Engine project and the Quay Container Registry . Create Code Engine project \u00b6 Step 1: Log on to IBM Cloud and navigate to the Code Engine projects \u00b6 Use following link to directly navigate to the Code Engine projects in IBM Cloud. https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/projects Step 2: Navigate to Code Engine projects in IBM Cloud and press Create \u00b6 Step 3: Create a Code Engine project called cloud-native-starter-[YOUR-EXTENTION] \u00b6 Enter following values, select create and wait until your project is created. Location : Dallas Name : cloud-native-starter-[YOUR-EXTENTION] (The name must be unique in the in Cloud Location Dallas ) Resource group: default The image below shows the created Code Engine project. IBM Cloud Shell \u00b6 Step 1: Open the IBM Cloud Shell \u00b6 When using the IBM Cloud Shell, no client-side setup is required for this workshop, it comes with all necessary CLIs (command line tools). Use following link to directly open the IBM Cloud Shell . https://cloud.ibm.com/shell In your browser, log in to the IBM Cloud Dashboard and open the IBM Cloud Shell from here: Note: Your workspace includes 500 MB of temporary storage. This session will close after an hour of inactivity. If you don't have any active sessions for an hour or you reach the 50-hour weekly usage limit, your workspace data is removed. Step 2: IBM Cloud Shell \u00b6 Now you are logged on with your IBM Cloud account. Deploy the example application \u00b6 Step 1: Clone the GitHub project to the IBM Cloud Shell \u00b6 Insert these commands to clone the GitHub project to the IBM Cloud Shell . git clone https://github.com/ibm/ce-cns.git cd ce-cns ROOT_FOLDER = $( pwd ) Step 2: Now set the environment variable for later usage \u00b6 REMEMBER! Your Code Engine project name cloud-native-starter-[YOUR-EXTENTION] export MYPROJECT = cloud-native-starter- [ YOUR-EXTENTION ] Step 3: Execute following bash automation \u00b6 Be patient, because the script may take several minutes ( up to 10 min ). cd $ROOT_FOLDER /CE bash ce-deploy-apps.sh Note: Here are the default values for the ce-deploy-apps.sh script: export PROJECT_NAME = $MYPROJECT #your project name export RESOURCE_GROUP = default #the resource group in IBM Cloud you defined during the creation of the project export REPOSITORY = tsuedbroecker #the name of the public container repository on Quay export REGION = \"us-south\" #the region in IBM Cloud that is used.

The bash script uses for example the ibmcloud target -g command to target IBM Cloud Resouce Group . ibmcloud target -g $RESOURCE_GROUP Step 4: Simplified steps of the bash script \u00b6 Here are the simplified steps that are carried out in the bash script using mainly the IBM Cloud Code Engine CLI : Connect to the Code Engine project with the Code Engine CLI and get the namespace for later usage to define the internal route. Deploy web-app to get needed route for the redirect of Keycloak Deploy Keycloak simply as a container (that's the reason why not scale to zero (stateful)) Configure the Keycloak realm json file based on the web-app url and create realm. Deploy articles microservice which is defined as local cluster here, we need to know the namespace . ( details are related to Knative ) Deploy web-api with the needed Keycloak and articles urls as environment variables. Reconfigure web-app with the needed Keycloak and web-api urls as environment variables. PS: You can also use the ce-deploy-apps-secret.sh script, which does create secrets for the user and password for the Keycloak container. cd $ROOT_FOLDER /CE bash ce-deploy-apps-secret.sh Step 5: Inspect the output \u00b6 The following shows an example execution result of the bash script and the last four lines do contain the routes to the applications. ************************************ URLs ************************************ - Keycloak : https://keycloak.9xztp8web0h.us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/quarkus - Web-API : https://web-api.9xztp8web0h.us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud - Articles : http://articles.9xztp8web0h.svc.cluster.local/articles - Web-App : https://web-app.9xztp8web0h.us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud You can open the example application with the Web-App link.
